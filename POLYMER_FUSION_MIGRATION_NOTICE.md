# Repository Migration Notice

## ⚠️ **MOVED TO NEW REPOSITORY**

The `polymer-induced-fusion` directory and all fusion-specific code have been **moved** to a dedicated repository:

**New Location**: [`polymer-fusion-framework`](../polymer-fusion-framework/)

### Migration Details
- **Date**: June 12, 2025
- **Reason**: Focus and modularity - separating fusion research from core GUT polymerization
- **Files Moved**: 113 files (11.43 MB total)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

### What Was Moved
All fusion-related code, documentation, and results:
- HTS materials simulation modules
- Polymer fusion enhancement algorithms  
- Reactor design and analysis tools
- Complete LaTeX documentation
- Simulation results and validation data
- Economic analysis frameworks

### Updated Structure

**Before:**
```
unified-gut-polymerization/
├── polymer-induced-fusion/    # ← MOVED
│   ├── hts_materials_simulation.py
│   ├── plan_a_*.py
│   ├── plan_b_*.py  
│   └── ...
└── [other GUT components]
```

**After:**
```
polymer-fusion-framework/         # ← NEW REPOSITORY
├── polymer-induced-fusion/       # ← MOVED HERE
│   ├── hts_materials_simulation.py
│   ├── plan_a_*.py
│   ├── plan_b_*.py
│   └── ...
├── README.md                     # ← NEW ROOT README
├── setup.py                      # ← NEW PACKAGING
└── requirements.txt              # ← NEW REQUIREMENTS

unified-gut-polymerization/       # ← FOCUSED ON GUT PHYSICS
├── [GUT polymerization only]
└── [no fusion code]
```

### How to Access
1. **New Repository**: Navigate to `../polymer-fusion-framework/`
2. **Same Functionality**: All scripts work identically
3. **Same Dependencies**: Requirements preserved
4. **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced README and setup files

### Quick Migration Commands
```bash
# Navigate to new location
cd ../polymer-fusion-framework/polymer-induced-fusion/

# Run HTS analysis (same as before)
python hts_materials_simulation.py

# Run fusion simulations (same as before)  
python plan_a_complete_demonstration.py
python plan_b_polymer_fusion.py
```

### Benefits of Migration
- ✅ **Focused Development**: Each repository has clear scope
- ✅ **Better Organization**: Fusion vs. fundamental physics separation
- ✅ **Simplified Dependencies**: Reduced cross-dependencies
- ✅ **Enhanced Documentation**: Dedicated fusion framework docs
- ✅ **Independent Versioning**: Separate release cycles

### Integration Status
The HTS materials simulation remains **fully integrated** with the phenomenology framework in `warp-bubble-optimizer/`, providing seamless co-simulation capabilities.

**For fusion research**: Use [`polymer-fusion-framework`](../polymer-fusion-framework/)  
**For GUT polymerization**: Continue using this repository

**Migration Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All fusion code successfully moved and operational
