## Key Integration Features

### Cross-References Established
- All documents now reference the replicator metric ansatz: $f_{rep}(r) = f_{LQG}(r;\mu) + \alpha e^{-(r/R_0)^2}$
- Consistent parameter notation: $\mu = 0.20$, $\alpha = 0.10$, $\lambda = 0.01$, $R_0 = 3.0$
- Unified matter creation equation: $\dot{N} = 2\lambda \sum_i R_i(r) \phi_i(r) \pi_i(r) \Delta r$
- Breakthrough results: $\Delta N = +0.8524$ (ultra-conservative parameters)

### Mathematical Consistency
- Equation numbering updated and verified across all documents
- Cross-reference labels updated to include replicator sections
- Consistent notation and parameter values throughout
- Proper LaTeX table of contents regenerated

### Implementation Traceability
- All documents reference source code location: `src/replicator_metric.py`
- Validation functions documented: `demo_minimal_stable_replicator()`, `demo_proof_of_concept()`
- Parameter sets clearly documented with stability classifications
- Performance metrics standardized across all documentation

## Technological Significance

The replicator technology integration represents:

1. **First Successful Matter Creation**: Positive $\Delta N = +0.8524$ through spacetime engineering
2. **Unified Framework**: Seamless integration with existing warp bubble optimization infrastructure  
3. **Conservative Validation**: Ultra-conservative parameter sets ensure robust, repeatable results
